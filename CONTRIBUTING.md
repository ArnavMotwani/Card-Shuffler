## What to contribute
This repo is one of my older repositories that has code from when i wasnt too experienced.
The code simply initialises an array of cards and shuffles them, read the ReadMe file for more details.

Instead of me improving this code, i though it was a good project for hacktoberfest beginners.

So how can you improve it?

* First you can make the code save Aces, jacks, queens and kings as A, J, Q, K instead of 1, 11, 12 and 13.
* Got an idea to make the code better in other ways? Do it.
* Want to add some feature to the code? Add it

I will merge any code that has some form of good improvement.

#### Have fun
